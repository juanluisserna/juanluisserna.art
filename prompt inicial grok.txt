Help me: I'm working on building my own website. I'm a professional photographer and I want this website to be my way to present my work and creativity to new clients. This is the code so far.
The idea is that the user experience is like navegating on a real life camera, with the screen on the left and the controls and information on the right.
If you make a change on the code give me back the full code to copy and paste it on my file.
